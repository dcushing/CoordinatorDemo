# CoordinatorDemo
A sample iOS app using the coordinator pattern to manage navigation

This is a sample iOS app I put together using the coordinator pattern as described here:

I wanted to create a project to put on GitHub that demonstrates how the coordinator pattern can be used to manage navigation using Storyboards, tab bars, and ViewControllers that can be dropped modally onto parent ViewControllers using protocols.

I admit that I am not an expert, but I really like this way of managing navigation outside of Storyboard segues, and I want more practice with it.
